It's been 4 years I live in Deutschland. And now I feel lonelier than ever.

Friends? What friends? If you consider me as your friend, I'm gladly accept that. But for my case, I rarely think one as a friend. Why, you ask? Well I don't have particular answer to that but once you are my friend, you will be my go-to person in case of anything.

But you still feel lonely?

Well, maybe because I'm getting more and more reclusive. I'm having trouble making new friends, facing exams, living my life as I would normally do. I lost my will.

Get a girlfriend?

I tried. Didn't get her. Still afraid to restart the whole relationship thing. The last time I had gf was 5 years ago. Yet it still aches me remembering that she didn't give any reason why she ended our relationship. Then now I'm just too obfuscated to know how to start new relationship.

Sometimes I'm just longing for a hug, long long hug which I don't have to let her go and so she doesn't have to let me go either. A hug which I can fall asleep on. A hug which calms me. A hug that releases all my fears and stresses. A hug which I won't get in the near future.

Now, I also lost my will to study properly. Not that I don't want to study, I just fear exams. The pressure is high, and I succumb to it. I can't handle pressure properly. It crushes me deep inside.

It's almost midnight here and I'm still not getting a hug I deserve.

And hopefully I don't succumb to my devil.
